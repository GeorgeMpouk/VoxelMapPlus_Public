# VoxelMapPlus

## Voxelmap++: Mergeable Voxel Mapping Method for Online LiDAR(-inertial) Odometry
## Introduction

**VoxelMapPlus** is an expension with some new features about VoxelMap (https://github.com/hku-mars/VoxelMap) 
1. Incrementally 3DOF plane fitting and update method based on least squares estimation
2. Plane merging method based on union-find which consider the coplanar relationship between voxel
3. Computationally efficient, low memory usage
4. Adapt different kinds of LiDARs (multi-spinning LiDARs and non-conventional solid-state LiDARs)
